# quizzify
This project implements a PDF document processing system that extracts text, semantically analyzes it, and generates quiz questions based on user queries. Leveraging a combination of advanced NLP models and relevance scoring algorithms, the system ensures that quiz questions are derived from the most pertinent information within the documents. Key features include:

Document Processing: Extracts and processes text from uploaded PDF files.
Semantic Search & Relevance Scoring: Identifies and prioritizes content related to the user's query.
Dynamic Question Generation: Generates coherent and contextually relevant quiz questions.
This project is ideal for creating educational tools, enhancing content comprehension, and developing interactive quizzes based on specific document content.
